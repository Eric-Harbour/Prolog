# rules say how to prove something:
# to prove the head,
# prove the conditions first

# this is a procedural way of thinking
# can also think purely logically

#instead of equating rules = instructions
# focus on their logical content

greatgrandparent(GGP, GGC) :-
    parent(GGP, GP), parent(GP,P), parent(P, GGC).

#Procedurely:
# to prove greatgrandparent(GGP, GGC),
# find some GP and P which you can prove parent (GGP, GP),
#then parent(GP,P), then parent(P, GGC).

#Logically: can be described as an assertino
#for all bindings of GGP, GP, P, and GGC,
# if parent(GGP,GP) and parent(GP,P) and parent(P,GGC),
# are true, then greatgrandparent(GGP,GGC) is true
